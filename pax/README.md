# Pax: The Development Ecosystem

Pax is the integration of OnixIDE (a real-time collaborative editor, https://github.com/ExoOnix/OnixIDE) and Coder (a developer workspace manager, https://github.com/coder/coder). It serves as the execution layer for all AI models within the Percy ecosystem, transforming software development into an intelligent, automated, and highly collaborative experience. Pax establishes an ecosystem where **infrastructure is defined as code**, and **code is expressed in natural language**.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Collaborative Editing

Powered by OnixIDE: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously with seamless synchronization.

AI-Driven Code Suggestions: AI models assist developers by generating code, refactoring suggestions, and explaining complex logic in natural language.

Context-Aware Chat: Integrated AI-driven discussions to provide insights, debug issues, and optimize code in real-time.

###  2. Infrastructure as Code & Code as Natural Language

Automatic Infrastructure Provisioning: Pax can generate workspace configurations, containerize environments, and deploy them seamlessly within Coder.

AI-Powered Code Understanding: Developers can describe functionality in natural language, and Pax will generate the corresponding code or infrastructure setup.

Version Control & Audit Logs: Tracks all AI-generated modifications for transparency and reproducibility.

### 3. Execution Hub for AI Models

AI-Driven Testing & CI/CD Optimization: Pax integrates Perceptor and Prowler to intelligently optimize test execution, detect vulnerabilities, and enhance deployment pipelines.

Latency Optimization: Marksman’s predictive caching and resource optimization models ensure faster execution of workspaces and test runs.

Custom AI Model Execution: Supports fine-tuned and pre-trained Prowler for code generation, security analysis, and performance optimization.

## Integration with Coder

Pax is deeply integrated with Coder to provide a seamless, cloud-based development experience:

**Dynamic Workspace Provisioning**: Pax generates Coder workspace configurations (.yml) dynamically based on project requirements and developer preferences.

**Preemptive Resource Allocation**: Using AI-powered predictions from Marksman, Pax pre-fetches dependencies and optimizes resource allocation in Coder workspaces.

**Seamless CI/CD Execution**: Perceptor-driven test selection and Prowler’s security audits run in parallel, reducing build times and preventing vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Future Vision

**AI-Enhanced Pair Programming**: AI agents acting as virtual collaborators within the development environment.

**Self-Optimizing Workspaces:** Workspaces that adapt to developer behavior and optimize their configurations dynamically.

Pax aims to be the foundation for AI-driven development workflows, ensuring a future where infrastructure is seamlessly managed, code is collaboratively enhanced, and development is driven by intelligent automation.
