# Marksman: AI Powered Predictive Caching and Resource Optimization

## Overview

Marksman is an intelligent system designed to optimize resource management for developers by implementing predictive caching, anomaly detection, and resource usage forecasting. It leverages machine learning models such as Markov chains and K-Means clustering to anticipate developer actions and optimize resource prefetching, significantly improving system efficiency.  

By integrating with Prometheus and Grafana, Marksman offers real-time monitoring, performance tracking, and predictive analytics.

## Features  

### üîπ Hybrid LRU-LFU Caching  
- Implements an optimized cache eviction strategy that balances frequency and recency of access.  
- Adapts dynamically using time-decayed access frequencies to prioritize important resources.

### üîπ Markov Model-based Predictions  
- Learns developer behavior and predicts the next likely resource accesses.  
- Adjusts dynamically based on historical usage and real-time updates.

### üîπ Resource Anomaly Detection  
- Uses weighted statistical anomaly detection with time decay to detect irregularities.  
- Monitors CPU, memory, disk, and network usage to flag unexpected behavior.

### üîπ Prefetching & Resource Prediction  
- Prefetches resources based on state transitions in the Markov Model.  
- Uses K-Means clustering to group similar resource usage patterns and optimize future allocations.  

### üîπ Prometheus & Grafana Integration  
Provides real-time dashboards with key metrics:  
- Cache hit/miss rates  
- Prediction accuracy  
- Resource usage statistics  
- Detected anomalies  

## How It Works  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Caching System  
- Uses a hybrid **Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU)** approach with time decay to make smarter eviction decisions.  
- Ensures high cache hit rates while avoiding bloating the cache with rarely used items.  
- **Metrics tracked:** cache hits, misses, evictions, and storage utilization.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Behavioral Prediction  
- The **Markov Model** tracks developer actions and transitions between states.  
- Predicts the most likely next state based on prior observations.  
- Works alongside the cache manager to **preload required resources**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Anomaly Detection  
- Uses **exponential time-decayed statistics** to weight recent observations more heavily.  
- Implements a **Z-score-based detection** for CPU, memory, disk, and network anomalies.  
- **Triggers alerts** when resource usage deviates significantly from the expected baseline.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Resource Optimization  
- Uses **K-Means clustering** to group historical resource usage patterns.  
- Predicts optimal CPU, memory, and network allocation for upcoming actions.  
- **Reduces wasted computing power** by aligning allocations with expected usage.  

## üöÄ Cost Reduction & Developer Experience Improvement  

### üìâ Projected Savings  
- Reduces **cache misses by ~30%**, leading to **faster load times** and lower infrastructure costs.  
- Lowers unnecessary **disk and network I/O operations by ~20%**, improving cloud efficiency.  
- Minimizes **CPU and memory spikes by ~15%** by detecting anomalies early and optimizing allocations.  
- Improves **IDE responsiveness by 35-50%** by prefetching frequently used resources in real-time.  

Note: All of these calculations are predicted based on few proof-of-concept testcases and may be wrong. 

### üí° How did we improve Developer Experience?
‚úÖ Faster IDE and development tools due to lower load times.  
‚úÖ Lower lag in accessing frequently used files, dependencies, and configurations.  
‚úÖ Reduced context-switching as the system intelligently prepares relevant resources in advance.  
‚úÖ Fewer unexpected slowdowns or crashes due to predictive resource allocation.  

## üìå Future Improvements (To-Do List)  
üîπ **Reinforcement Learning-based State Transitions** to refine predictions.  
üîπ **Federated Learning Support** for decentralized data collection and privacy-preserving training.  
üîπ **Granular Real-Time Analytics** with deeper integration into DevOps pipelines.
